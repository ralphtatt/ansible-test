# Ansible Basics

## What is this repo?

This repo contains a configuration for helping understand and test Ansible. It is relatively simple and contrived to be the barebones of Ansible, so does not reflect a real set up. However, it does still have utility in helping understand using Ansible.

### Projects

There is a [projects](./PROJECTS.md) file which contains some ideas of projects that could be used with Anisble.

## Development

### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites:

- Ansible
- Docker
- Docker Compose
